A Flask app is a web application built using the Flask framework in Python.
What does a Flask app do?

📦 Handles routes like /upload or /login (via HTTP methods like GET, POST)

🧠 Runs Python logic behind those routes (e.g., store a file, query a database)

🖥️ Returns responses (HTML pages, JSON data, file downloads, etc.)

✅ In your project:
Your Flask app handles file uploads, lists stored files from Google Cloud Storage, and lets users download or delete them — all via API routes defined in Python.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  explain this

Sure! Here's a clear explanation of each command you listed — they’re commonly used to set up a Python project with isolated dependencies using a virtual environment:

🐍 1. python -m venv venv
This creates a new virtual environment named venv.

📦 A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment where you can install packages without affecting the global Python installation.

The directory venv/ will contain its own Python interpreter and libraries.

➡️ After running this, you’ll see a new folder named venv/ created in your project directory.

💻 2. source venv/bin/activate
(Or on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

This command activates the virtual environment.

On macOS/Linux: use source venv/bin/activate

On Windows: use venv\Scripts\activate

✅ Once activated, your terminal prompt may change to show (venv), and any packages you install with pip will go into the virtual environment instead of the global system.

📥 3. pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs all the Python packages listed in the file requirements.txt.

requirements.txt is a plain text file containing a list of Python libraries and their versions, for example:


Flask==2.3.2
google-cloud-storage==2.14.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
📦 This ensures your project has all the necessary dependencies installed in the virtual environment.
